Aka. Non-Business Requirements.

### Development
* Uniform dev. environment
* "Live like" data
* Fast tests (budget?)

* One "Best Practice" setup .. custom setup possible.

### Tests
* Unit
* Integration
* Contracts between services (automatic mock?)
* UI (in browser / headless?)

## Operation
* Deploy should be automated 
* Alert on abnormalities
* Self healing 
* Centralized Logging
