# Microservices.

Here at [Gul og Gratis](AboutUs.md) we have started to transition away from a legacy \(read spaghetti\) monolith to a more modern and more agile set of microservices.

## This Book.

This book will be a mix of theories, ideas and decisions I've made through the process of modernizing our stack. It is also a way for new developers to understand the thoughts behind the decisions/tradeoffs we will make during the process. 

## You, the Reader.

You as the reader does not have a clear path through this book, but can to jump around and read the sections that you find the most interesting. 

I hope you will join in and comment and maybe even write some of the sections for/with me. And when \(not if\) you find something that is unclear or just plain wrong then tell me and help me fix it.
