# Going from Monolith to Microservices

# Monolith
A monolith is a system where the complete or at least the majority of the code of a website has to be deployed on each instance / server in order for it to work.

#### The Good Parts
Many changes and be done using automatic refactorings. Changes are easy to coordinate and correlate across components and with one task in Jira. Deploying it is easy as it is all or nothing.

#### The Bad Parts
Iif a part of the system needs to scale you have to scale all of it, even the heavy parts that might be rarely used. Another problem with monoliths is that it is too easy to make hard coupling between components that are not directly related. This can of course be handled by discipline but rarely is.

## Transition vs Big Bang

Originally the idea was to do a full rewrite in one go .. aka "Big Bang" .. but we now work on changing to a transitional shift. This means that we now change one section / page / element at the time.

Doing the changes gradually has some advantages and disadvantages over the full rewrite:

**Pros**
* Every change is smaller, which means less risk
* Easier to scale 
* Incremental changes => less alienated users
* Continuously use learning to improve

**Cons**
* Design changes has to balance between changing too much from the old and changing enough.
* Adaptive / Responsive design will either have to be only on some pages
* .. or only when enough sections / pages are done
* Bigger overhead as some changes affects both old and new code
* .. which leads to slower progress
* Harder to move to the cloud (some here / some there)
* Data transition is harder (who owns the data)
