# The Rewrite

The goal of the rewrite project is to make our site more maintainable, so that it will be easier to add new features in the future. We should also strive to be more resilient to failure and improve our ability to scale with the ebb and flow of traffic.

## Other "Soft" Requirements

* Desktop and mobile sites should be one
* User behaviour should be measurable
* Feature impact should be measurable
* Outsourcing of services should be possible
* Users should be deletable (anonymised)
